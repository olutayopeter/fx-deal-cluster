# Fx Deal Cluster

## Important Note: This project's new milestone is to move The whole system to work on Kubernetes, so stay tuned.

This documentation provides an overview of the Spring Boot application along with instructions for Docker deployment.

## Application Overview
The Spring Boot application is a RESTful service designed to accept FX deals details and persist them into a database. It includes validation for deal structures and prevents importing duplicate requests. The application is built using Spring Boot, and it uses MySQL as the database.

## Docker Deployment
To deploy the Spring Boot application with Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build Docker Image**: Run the following command to build the Docker image for the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    docker build -t spring-boot-app .
    ```

2. **Run Docker Compose**: Run the following command to start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. **Access Application**: Once the containers are running, you can access the Spring Boot application at `http://localhost:8080`.
### Configuration
The application configuration can be found in the `application.properties` file. Modify this file to change the application properties such as database connection details.

### Testing
The application includes unit tests for both the controller and service layers. To run the tests, execute the following command:
```bash
mvn test

### Dependencies
The application utilizes the following dependencies:

Spring Boot Starter Web
Spring Boot Starter Data JPA
Spring Boot Starter Test
MySQL Driver
